Processing Time Summary:
------------------------
Total Time Elapsed: 1,939.1000 seconds

Segmentation Quality Analysis (Jaccard Distance):
-------------------------------------------------
Total Samples: 105
Average Jaccard Distance: 0.5962
Standard Deviation: 0.0873
Minimum Jaccard Distance: 0.2939
Maximum Jaccard Distance: 0.7521

Interpretation:
---------------
- A lower Jaccard Distance means better segmentation accuracy.
- A high standard deviation suggests variability in segmentation performance.
- If the average Jaccard Distance is close to 0, the model performed well.
- If the maximum Jaccard Distance is high, some images were segmented poorly.
